# This script requires NXAPITransport and the cisco remote access libraries
# These are available from Cisco Dev Net at https://developer.cisco.com/web/n9k/downloads
# Under the Downloads section named nx-os-remote-client.tgz
# Once downloaded, unpack these and place this script in the same directory as the
# 'cisco' and 'utils' directories
#
#
# This script uses the NXAPI remote API to query a list of Nexus 9000 devices, issuing the same
# command on each of them, and then comparing the results with each other
# Any values that do not match between the first switch in the list and any other
# will be printed in a tabular form
#
# Note: due to differences in the way data is returned for different commands, the comparison
# logic below may need to be modified, to look at different tiers.
